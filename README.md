Hardships
=========
I personally have not interacted with APIs and working in the backend. I've learned A LOT from this week of working on this challenge. From learning how to make an API call, then pulling information from that API, then displaying the API data on to the client side, and picking dependencies. Unfortunately, I have missed a few requirements as shown above but, overall, this was a wonderful experience and would be glad to go over all this again! I am always willing to learn more! Thank you for time!

Future features
===============
- Pagination
- Search
- Sort
- Manipulating tickets
